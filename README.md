# Arduino-monitoring-themperature-and-alarm-with-DS18B20-and-SSD1306

This project displays the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit degrees on a SSD1306 OLED display. It also has 2 LEDs, one RED and one GREEn, for showing if the temperature is under a threshhold established in the program. I decided in the code this value to be 65 C, but it can be modified by writing another value.
